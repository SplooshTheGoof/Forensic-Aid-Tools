This is a preliminary version of the command + output printer method. (I need a better name)

To run the command you need to first ensure that it is compiled: do this by running the following command "python -m py_compile Script.py" (use either the relitive or absolute address of "Script.py"

Once compiled, navigate to Script dir on the Desktop in your terminal ie."cd Desktop/Script/"

Then, you can run the script using "python3 Scripts.py" the output is always sent to the .txt doccument "CommandOutput.txt" in the CWD.  

*******************************************************************************************
If you wish to clear the Doccument, Run "Script.py" and simply input "z0z' as your command.
